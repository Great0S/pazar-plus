🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC
====================================================

📋 VPS DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
=======================

1. 📥 PULL THE LATEST CODE:
   git pull origin enhanced

2. 🔄 RUN DATABASE MIGRATION:
   cd server
   npm run migrate
   # This will run: update-creation-source-enum-values.js

3. 🔍 VERIFY ENUM VALUES:
   psql -d pazar_plus -c "SELECT unnest(enum_range(NULL::creation_source_enum));"
   
   Expected output:
   - user
   - platform_sync  
   - excel_import
   - api_import
   - platform       ← NEW
   - legacy         ← NEW

4. 🔄 RESTART THE APPLICATION:
   pm2 restart pazar-plus
   # or
   npm run start

5. 📊 MONITOR LOGS:
   pm2 logs pazar-plus
   # Look for successful sync operations

📝 MIGRATION DETAILS:
====================

The migration will:
✅ Add "platform" and "legacy" to creation_source_enum
✅ Update existing "platform_sync" values to "platform" 
✅ Preserve all existing data
✅ Maintain backward compatibility during transition

🛡️ SAFETY MEASURES:
==================

✅ Backward compatibility: Code handles both "platform_sync" and "platform"
✅ Non-breaking migration: Existing data is preserved
✅ Rollback capability: Migration includes down() method
✅ Error handling: Comprehensive logging and error recovery

🧪 POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING:
==========================

1. Test platform-originated product sync:
   - Find a product with creationSource="platform" 
   - Update it and verify it only syncs to origin platform

2. Test user-created product sync:
   - Find a product with creationSource="user"
   - Update it and verify it syncs to all platforms

3. Monitor error logs for enum-related issues

⚠️  TROUBLESHOOTING:
===================

If you see "invalid input value for enum" errors:
1. Check if migration ran successfully
2. Verify enum values with SQL query above
3. Restart application to reload enum cache
4. Check logs for detailed error messages

🎯 SUCCESS INDICATORS:
=====================

✅ No enum validation errors in logs
✅ Products sync to correct platforms based on creation source
✅ Platform-originated products only sync to origin
✅ User-created products sync to all platforms
✅ Improved sync performance and reduced API calls

📞 SUPPORT:
===========

If issues arise:
1. Check pm2 logs for detailed errors
2. Verify database connection and enum values
3. Test with a small batch of products first
4. Contact development team with specific error logs
