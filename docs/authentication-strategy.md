# Authentication Enhancement Strategy

## Current Implementation
- Basic JWT authentication
- Standard login/register endpoints
- Token-based authorization middleware

## Future Authentication Roadmap

### Phase 1: Security Enhancements
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add email verification for new accounts
- Strengthen password policies
- Implement token refresh mechanism

### Phase 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Create role hierarchy (Admin, Manager, Support, User)
- Implement permission-based route protection
- Add granular access controls for different operations
- Role-management administrative interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Security Features
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- OAuth2 integration for third-party login
- IP-based access restrictions
- Device tracking and suspicious activity detection

### Phase 4: Enterprise Integration
- LDAP/Active Directory integration
- Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities
- SAML support for enterprise authentication
- Custom identity provider integration

## Implementation Guidelines

### Token Management
- Reduce JWT expiration time to 15-30 minutes
- Implement refresh tokens with longer validity
- Store token blacklist for revoked tokens

### Security Best Practices
- Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints (already in place)
- Add CSRF protection
- Enable secure and HTTP-only cookies
- Add comprehensive security headers

### User Experience
- Implement "Remember Me" functionality
- Add account lockout after failed attempts
- Provide session management for users

## Technology Recommendations
- Consider migrating to a dedicated auth provider like Auth0 or Keycloak
- Evaluate Passport.js for enhanced authentication strategies
- Implement Redis for token storage and blacklisting
