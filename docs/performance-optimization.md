# Performance Optimization Strategy

## Current State Analysis
- Express server with basic configuration
- SQLite database for development
- Simple query patterns without optimization
- Basic error handling and logging

## Performance Optimization Roadmap

### Phase 1: Database Optimization

- Implement database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Optimize complex SQL queries
- Implement query caching mechanism
- Add database connection pooling
- Consider migration path to PostgreSQL for production

### Phase 2: API Performance


- Implement response compression (already in place)
- Add API response caching with Redis
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Optimize JSON serialization/deserialization
- Add ETags for conditional requests

### Phase 3: Asynchronous Processing
- Implement job queue for long-running tasks
- Move order processing to background workers
- Implement webhook delivery via queue system
- Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Optimize bulk operations with batch processing

### Phase 4: Scaling Strategy
- Implement horizontal scaling capabilities
- Add load balancing configuration
- Implement service discovery for microservices
- Containerize application with Docker
- Prepare Kubernetes deployment configurations

## Monitoring and Optimization
- Implement performance metrics collection
- Add APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- Set up automated alerting for performance thresholds
- Create performance dashboards
- Implement regular performance testing

## Implementation Details

### Database Optimizations
```sql
-- Example indexes for Order table
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON Orders (status);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON Orders (customerId);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created_at ON Orders (createdAt);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_platform ON Orders (platformId);
```

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed data:
  - Order statistics
  - Platform configurations
  - Shipping rate calculations
  - Product information
- Cache invalidation strategy:
  - Time-based expiration
  - Event-based invalidation
  - Selective cache purging

### Code-level Optimizations
- Optimize API response payloads
- Implement lazy loading for related data
- Use streaming for large data exports
- Optimize PDF generation process
- Minimize database round trips

## Technology Recommendations
- Redis for caching and job queues
- PM2 for process management and clustering
- DataDog or New Relic for performance monitoring
- PostgreSQL for production database
- Nginx for load balancing and request optimization
