## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Pazar+ seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to the project maintainer through GitHub
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity within 5 business days
- **Fix**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed immediately, others within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure

### Security Best Practices

When deploying Pazar+:

1. **Environment Variables**: Always use strong, unique values for:
   - `JWT_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
   - `SESSION_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
   - Database passwords

2. **Database Security**: 
   - Use SSL/TLS connections in production
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Regular security updates

3. **API Security**:
   - Enable rate limiting in production
   - Use HTTPS only
   - Implement proper CORS policies

4. **Platform Credentials**:
   - Store marketplace API keys securely
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Use test environments for development

## Known Security Considerations

- This application handles sensitive e-commerce data
- Platform API credentials are encrypted in the database
- User authentication uses bcrypt for password hashing
- CSRF protection is implemented for web forms
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions and announced in the repository releases.
